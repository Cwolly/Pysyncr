Pysyncr workflow

1) First time the user opens the program a GUI pops open and asks the user for
    A) server name or IP
        I) Attempts to connect to server and verify that the pysyncr server is operational. If this            works, move on, if not let the user know that hostname/IP is incorrect. Do not let user            proceed.
    B) existing username and password, or (goto 4)
    C) to create a new username and password (goto 2)

2) If a user selects to create username they are prompted with a new screen that asks for an email address, username and password. '''Not sure if email should be optional, but it would be nice to kick off an email to the user with their account info.'''

3) Server checks if username exists. If it does, error, please use different name. If it does not, username is created on the server and a folder is created for the user, associated with the username, and is the user's "pysyncr folder".

4) Prompt user for local pysyncr folder. This folder can be an existing folder, or the user can create it.

5) Initial sync from local folder to server folder happens. A notification icon sits in the tray to notify user that the process is taking place.

6) Daemon process kicks off an waits for notification from Kernel if a file changes, if it does, folders sync again.
